# when 的用法

when 所引導的形容詞子句用於修飾「時間」的名詞。另外我們也知道

- 使用介系詞 on 來代表日子，比方說：on Monday、on May 1st 等
    

- 使用 in 來代表月、年等一段時間，像是 in October、in 2016
    

- 使用 at 來代表幾點幾分，如 at 10 o’clock。
    

也因此，關係副詞 when 可以等於 in which、on which 與 at which

請看以下例句：

▼ Friday is usually the day when we hold our weekly meeting.  
= Friday is usually the day on which we hold our weekly meeting.  
（週五通常是我們舉辦週會的日子。）

▼ August is the month when the temperature is usually the highest in Taiwan.  
= August is the month in which the temperature is usually the highest in Taiwan  
（八月是台灣氣溫最高的月份。）
