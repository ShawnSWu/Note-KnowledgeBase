# 1. 前句是表示『人』的時候

### **關係代名詞便以 who 表示主詞，whose 表示所有格，whom 表示受詞。**  
請注意，使用關係代名詞時，原本被取代的名詞或代名詞便不可再重複表示！

▼ This is the accountant who conducted the audit for our company.  
(這位就是協助我們公司做稽核查帳的會計師。)

▼ The woman whose suitcase was stolen called the police.  
(那位行李被偷的女子打電話給警察。)

▼ The man whose car is parked here is back.  
(那位把車停在這的男子回來了。)

▼ The woman whom you met yesterday in the conference is my supervisor.  
(你昨天在會議當中遇到的女子是我老闆。)

▼ That’s the writer whom I have great respect for.  
(那就是我相當尊敬的一個作者。)

▼ The client for whom I’ve been waiting is finally here.  
(我一直在等的那位客戶終於到了。)

# 2. 前句是表示『**事／物**』時

**關係代名詞使用which 來表示主詞和受詞，使用whose 表示所有格。**

▼ This is the report which contains sales figures of the 1st quarter.  
(這就是包含第一季業績數字的報告。)

▼ This is the meeting agenda which Sarah gave me.  
(這份就是莎拉給我的會議議程。)

▼ This is the technical guide whose contents were modified by Mr. Jones.  
(這份就是瓊斯先生改過內容的技術手冊。)

# **3. 先行詞是人、事、物，都可以使用 that 來表示主詞和受詞。**

**that 可代替關係代名詞 who、whom 或which。**

▼ This is the sales representative that ( = who) closed the CIT deal.  
(這位就是結下 CIT 案子的業務代表。)

▼ The boy that ( = whom) you met yesterday is my son.  
(你昨天遇到的男孩是我兒子。)

▼ This is the meeting agenda that ( = which) Sarah gave me.  
(這份就是莎拉給我的會議議程。)

在關係代名詞前有介系詞時，關係代名詞就不能使用that，比方說：

▼ This is the office where Mr. Jones works.  
= ~~This is the office~~ **~~in that~~** ~~Mr. Jones works. (X)~~  
（這間就是瓊斯先生的辦公室。）

▼ The concert which we went to yesterday was fantastic.  
= The concert to which we went yesterday was fantastic.  
= The concert that we went to yesterday was fantastic.  
= The concert we went to yesterday was fantastic. （that 可省略）  
~~The concert~~ **~~to that~~** ~~we went yesterday was fantastic. (X)~~  
（我們昨天去聽的演唱會很棒。）

在關係代名詞前面有逗號「,」時，關係代名詞也不可使用that。比方說：

▼ Mr. Jones works in a huge office, which is located on the 3rd floor.  
~~Mr. Jones works in a huge office,~~ **~~that~~** ~~is located on the 3rd floor. (X)~~  
（瓊斯先生在三樓那間非常大的辦公室內工作。）  

▼ Susan didn’t get a promotion, which disappointed her a lot.  
~~Susan didn’t get a promotion,~~ **~~that~~** ~~disappointed her a lot. (X)~~  
（蘇珊沒被升遷，對此她感到很失望。）

**4. 複合關係代名詞 what 具有先行詞和關係代名詞之性質，也就是說 what = the thing that。**

▼ What I really need now is your advice.  
= The thing that I really need now is your advice.  
（我現在所需要的是你的建議。）

▼ What I would like you guys to do is to elect a team leader first.  
= The thing that I would like you guys to do is to elect a team leader first.  
（我現在想要大家做的是先選一個隊長。）

▼ What he mentioned was probably true.  
= The thing that he mentioned was probably true.  
（他所說的有可能是真的。）

另外，也因複合關係代名詞 what 已包括先行詞在內了，所以前面不可再有先行詞。

▼ Jack spends what he earns every month.  
= Jack spends the money that he earns every month.  
Jack spends **the money what** he earns every month. (X)  
（傑克每個月都把他賺的錢花掉。）

▼ I don’t really understand what you are talking about.  
= I don’t really understand the thing that you are talking about.  
I don’t really understand **the thing what** you are talking about. (X)  
（我並不太了解你在說些什麼。）

▼ What he said was perfectly true.  
= The thing that he said was perfectly true.  
**The thing what** he said was perfectly true. (X)  
（他所說的完全是真的。）
