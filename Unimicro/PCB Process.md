## Material:

1.  **==Copper foil==(銅片)** 
    ![[Pasted image 20240529101100.png]]

2. ==Laminate== (可稱『基材』或『覆铜板』)
	It's a basis board in PCB. 
	Providing mechanical and electrical connection through a multi-layer structure. 
	After etching and drilling step, the Laminate will become a final correct PCB with circuit 
   ![[Pasted image 20240529102334.png]]

3. ==Etch Photoresist==
   **It's a photoresist coating(感光塗層) for printing circuit process**, it's using for etching process in PCB.
   
   After Exposure and Development, it will masks the circuit areas that don't need to be etched.
   
   This's a approach for protecting material of specific areas.
   **To prevent these areas are etched during etch process**.
   
   Primarily using implementing the required circuit patterns on the *Artwork*.

	This piece in the picture call **Photomask** (光罩).
## Process approach

### Drilling (鑽孔)

  **The purpose of drilling** is to create holes for each electronic component. 
  After drilling, the board will be clean by cleaning machine to ensure no drilling residue remains.
  
  * **Registration hole**
  It's used to ensure proper alignment and precision throughout the manufacturing steps.(確保各製造步驟中對準和精確對齊的孔)

  **Purpose:**:
  - **Pattern Alignment**: Ensuring the accurate transfer of circuit patterns onto the PCB.
    
  - **Layer Alignment**: Ensuring correct alignment of the inner and outer layer patterns in multilayer boards.
    
  - **Drilling Alignment**: Preventing drilling misalignment(錯位) that could affect electrical performance and component installation.
    
  - **Assembly Alignment**: Ensuring correct placement and soldering of components.

### Designing circuit (電路設計)

The circuit diagram is generated by software. it will generate the design files(*Gerber file*), as know as *Artwork*, it describe the overall layout and circuit connections of the PCB.

Artwork can be in electronic format, such as Gerber files, or in physical form.
![[Pasted image 20240529130657.png|300]]
> [!info] Gerber是一種二維向量圖檔格式。 它是印刷線路板行業軟體中用於描述印刷線路板圖像的標準格式，

### Etching Process (蝕刻)

蝕刻是將 *Copper Laminate* 上未被抗蝕劑（resistive mask）保護的銅去除，留下需要的電路圖案，也就是電路板上的銅線(Copper traces)


1. Apply photoresist: Apply the photoresist onto the *Copper laminate*
   Liquid photoresist can be applied using spin coating or spray coating equipment.
   (液態的photoresist可以用噴的覆蓋到*Copper laminate*)

2. **Exposure and Development**：

* Exposure(曝光)：將*Copper laminate*放置在曝光設備中，透過光罩將紫外光照射在抗蝕劑上，形成所需的電路圖案。
  
* Development(顯影)：將曝光後的覆銅板浸入顯影液中，去除未曝光或曝光區域的抗蝕劑，露出需要蝕刻的銅箔區域。

3. **Etch**： Put the developed *Copper laminate* in the etching solution. The copper foil areas not protected by the photoresist are dissolved, circuit pattern will show up.

4. **Photoresist Removal**: After etching is complete, 
   remove the remaining photoresist to reveal the final copper wire pattern

# Manufacturing process

1. A copper foil will be laminated on a Laminate. 
   Following description, this board will be called *Copper Laminate*
   
2. Go into the **Drilling** step，*Copper Laminate* do **Registration hole** first.
   
3. Following that, the drilling machine will drill holes based on the Gerber file.
   
   Additionally, a **Photomask** will be produced based on the Gerber file.
   
4. On the *Copper Laminate*, **Etch Photoresist** is applied (or use Photomask).
   ![[Pasted image 20240529150809.png|200]]
   
5. **Using Aligner(曝光機)** => UV light is projected onto the *Copper Laminate* covered with **Etch Photoresist**. Through UV exposure, chemical changes occur in the exposed areas.
   ![[UV process.gif|500]]
   
6. **Start Etch process** => After development, the *Copper Laminate* is immersed into an etching solution. 
   The areas of copper not protected by the resist are etched away, resulting in the desired circuit patterns.
  
   **Immersed in developer(浸入顯影劑)** => The exposed *Copper Laminate* is immersed in developer solution, which dissolves the unexposed resist, revealing(暴露) the copper areas to be etched, typically an alkaline solution.
   (將曝光後的 *Copper Laminate* 浸入到顯影液中，顯影液會溶解未曝光的抗蝕劑，露出需要蝕刻的copper foil區域，液體通常會是鹼性液體(Alkaline)。

   **Photoresist Removal**: After etching is complete, 
   remove the remaining photoresist to reveal the final copper wire pattern

8. solder mask coating（阻焊層） 
   
   It is a protective layer applied to the surface of a PCB, 
   typically green in color(==this's why the color always Green==), 
   
   mainly used to:
   1. Protect copper traces and circuits
   2. Define soldering areas
    
    Solder mask覆蓋在PCB表面上，保護銅線和電路免受外部環境的影響
